// 1. something about Romania
printf("1....the first");

/*Romania is located in Southeastern Europe and has its Capital in the city of Bucharest. It borders the Black Sea, 
 Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia and Moldova.
 It has an area of 238397(two hundred thirty eight thousand three hundred ninety seven) square kilometers and a 
 temperate continental climate. So, Romania has almost 20 million inhabitants and from this point
 of view the country is the seventh most populous member state of the European Union. I live in Timisoara which is 
 situated in east side of the country on the Bega river.
 Timisoara is third most populous city in the country with approximately 320.000 inhabitants. 
 In 2021 this beautiful city was selected as the European Capital of Culture.
 So, in Timisoara, there are a lot of multinational IT companies like Intel, Continental, Nokia and Athos which
 developer a lot of IT products.
 A year ago I got hired at the Continental company , but in the past I worked for two other small companies.
 I have a lot of problems with my English, but I hope to overcome this and to be better in what I do.

 //2.Winter season and Christmas
 
 /*Winter is my favorite season. It begins in December and ends in March. I like it because I was born on the 24th of December. 
 On this day, I like to go home and stay with my family and my friends. During this beautiful period, each year I have holidays,
 so I don't have to go to work. The day after my birthday is Christmas. This Christmas, I went to my village, but I was a little bit upset.
 It was cold, but there was no snow. So, I just stayed home and I ate a lot, because my mom prepared a lot of food.
 I played some chess with my uncle and I went to visit my relatives. In my village there are a bunch of traditions and I like to enjoy them. 
 When I was a child, in the winter, there was a lot of snow, but unfortunately, the climate has changed. The temperature rises and drops very suddenly, 
 and now we cannot have a climate specific to the one season. I hope that in the future, we can fix that by saving the forest and not polluting the air.
