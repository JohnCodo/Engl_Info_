1. Do you prefer shopping in a mall or online ???? 

Hello. My name is Sarah. I'm Belgian and I'm currently living in Denmark. 
The question I'll be answering is do you prefer shopping in a mall or online?
And for me it depends. I usually do my shopping online simply because I find it easier to find the things I need.
So it saves time, it's less stressful and you can usually find the things cheaper. 
On the other hand, I do like shopping in the mall as well, especially if you go with a friend, boyfriend, girlfriend,
family member, because it can just be such a fun way to spend the time together, especially if you go into some fun stores 
and you can browse through items together, have a good laugh, and you do definitely get some inspiration of things that 
you wouldn't have necessarily thought of, so it's a good way of expanding your horizon.
But yeah, so for browsing and experience, I'd say the mall, for actual buying things, I usually shop online.
