1.DO YOU PREFER SHOPPING IN A MALL OR ONLINE?

Hello. My name is Sarah. I'm Belgian and I'm currently living in Denmark. 
The question I'll be answering is do you prefer shopping in a mall or online?
And for me it depends. I usually do my shopping online simply because I find it easier to find the things I need.
So it saves time, it's less stressful and you can usually find the things cheaper. 
On the other hand, I do like shopping in the mall as well, especially if you go with a friend, boyfriend, girlfriend,
family member, because it can just be such a fun way to spend the time together, especially if you go into some fun stores 
and you can browse through items together, have a good laugh, and you do definitely get some inspiration of things that 
you wouldn't have necessarily thought of, so it's a good way of expanding your horizon.
But yeah, so for browsing and experience, I'd say the mall, for actual buying things, I usually shop online.

1.THE OMELET
I want to make an omelet. So actually this is really silly, I've never made one before. How do you make an omelet?
First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl. 
Whisk them up, so they're quite high and fluffy. 
In a hot pan, and you need a pan that's that's kind of small that the sides go up at an angle.
You put some oil and heat it up, so it's quite hot. Then you take your whipped up eggs or whisked up eggs and pour them
into the pan.As it's cooking, if you take a spatula and push the bottom layer of the egg to the sides and then to 
the middle so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan.
And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked. You should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over.
You'll only have to cook that side lightly. ut your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just 
long enough to melt the cheese.Wow. What fillings do you recommend?
Well, if you want to do a real simple one, you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese. 
That's easy or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, anything that you like.
If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture. It's actually cooked in it. 
It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese.
